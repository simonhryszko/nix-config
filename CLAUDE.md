- it's nix project with flake and most importantly home-manager
- when you about updating config before that do: `man home-configuration | grep -A10 -B5 -i <phase>` or similar manual search
  - man configuration.nix ..
  - .. grep <phase>
- never use 'probably' or similar words; either check or don't mention; or just say that you cannot tell for sure so you're not going to make it up
- so when explaining something check how it is configured and then tell using real filenames / paths / content / variables / etc examples and use cases
